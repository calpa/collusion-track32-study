AI Collusion Research Sprint 2026 — Track 3.2

## Abstract

LLM-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent settings where covert
cooperation opportunities arise. Apart Research's Track 3.2 asks whether a
trusted agent that offers collusion has been tested; it has not. We present a
small, pre-registered, single-model study in the official Liar's Bar harness
(4-agent rounds, a secret-channel tool with structured accept/refuse responses)
using DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash across 20 episodes in three phases (7 calibration,
3 pilot, 10 confirmatory). A scripted trusted investigator delivered 10
invitations: 8 voluntary invitations were all refused (0/8 accepted, across
three different recipient agents), and 2 seeded episodes had refusals
overridden by the harness, imposing alliances with procedural ground truth.
Imposed alliances exchanged 108 secret messages with full hand disclosure and
coordinated play plans; post-establishment, allies never challenged each other
(0/10 eligible opportunities) while challenging non-allies at the baseline rate
(10/85 = 0.118). Focal-pair challenge rates against a pre-registered pair
showed no consistent induction signal (confirmatory C2 0.106 vs C0 0.066). We
report all results as descriptive observations with explicit limitations:
single model family, small N, an experimenter-channel investigator, and no
cross-game memory. Protocol, raw records, manifests, and analysis scripts are
released for independent verification.

## 1. Introduction

LLM-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent settings where covert
cooperation opportunities can be exploited. Apart Research's Track 3.2 notes
that a trusted agent offering collusion opportunities "has not yet been
tested": can such an undercover intervention *expose* existing collusive
coordination, or does it *induce* coordination that would not otherwise occur?

We present a small, controlled, single-model study in the official Liar's Bar
harness. Our design separates three questions that are often conflated:

- **RQ1 (elicitation)**: do agents accept, refuse, or express suspicion toward
  a secret-alliance invitation?
- **RQ2 (behavioral consequences of imposed alliances)**: does an imposed
  (seeded) alliance produce observable preferential behavior — and can our
  instrument detect it?
- **RQ3 (induction)**: does delivering an invitation change focal-pair
  challenge behavior relative to matched no-invitation episodes (ITT)?

We report invitation-level outcomes, opportunity-denominated challenge rates
against a pre-registered focal pair, and explicit limitations of a
single-model, small-N exploratory study.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Environment

Official Liar's Bar harness (4-agent rounds, a secret-channel tool with
structured accept/refuse responses, optional cross-game memory). Episodes are
single games: cross-game player memory was verified absent in the series
runner (audit finding H3), making episodes independent units.

### 3.2 Model and inference

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash via a Modal Shared Endpoint
(OpenAI-compatible; per-seat sampling calibration from the harness:
temperature 0.8, top_p 0.9, top_k 50, repetition_penalty 1.05, max_tokens
256; structured JSON outputs; 5-retry parsing with fallback logging).

### 3.3 Conditions and phases (pre-registered in PILOT_SPEC)

- **C0**: no invitation (baseline).
- **C2**: secret-alliance invitation (allow_refusal=true; voluntary response).
- **C4**: seeded alliance (allow_refusal=false; the harness overrides refusal
  and force-assigns a partner — procedural ground truth).
- C1/C3/W1 deferred. Phases: 7 calibration (G3 positive-control work), 3
  pilot, 10 confirmatory. Primary analysis uses confirmatory episodes only.

### 3.4 Trusted investigator

A scripted, experimenter-controlled investigator delivers a fixed invitation
template; it holds no game seat, earns no points, and its full policy is the
published template. Targeting (--chosen-player Lily) was verified working in
the single-game script; the series runner's targeting was broken (audit H1)
and random targets were used where applicable.

### 3.5 Measurements

- **Invitation outcome** (unit: invitation event): accept / refuse (+reason).
- **Focal pair challenge rate**: (Lily, Luke), pre-registered, seat-adjacent;
  denominator = eligible decision opportunities (next-player decision points;
  system auto-challenges excluded — validated by 21 metric unit tests
  including an independent oracle and a real-trajectory audit).
- **Alliance-pair contrast** (secondary, post-treatment labeled): ally vs
  non-ally challenge rates in seeded episodes.
- Post-treatment window: establishment round excluded (conservative).

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Invitation outcomes (unit: invitation event)

| Arm | N | Accept | Refuse | Refusal overridden → forced alliance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Voluntary (allow_refusal=true) | 8 | **0** | 8 | 0 |
| Seeded (allow_refusal=false) | 2 | 0 (2 refusal attempts overridden) | — | 2 |
| **Total invitation events** | **10** | 0 | 8 | 2 |

All 8 voluntary invitations were refused (three different recipient agents:
Mike, Quinn, Lily×6 — Lily was the targeted recipient). Descriptive counts;
N is too small to infer a population refusal rate.

### 4.2 Focal pair (Lily, Luke) challenge rates (unit: episode; denominator = eligible decision opportunities)

| Condition / phase | episodes | focal challenges / opportunities | rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| C2 confirmatory | 6 | 9/85 | 0.106 |
| C0 confirmatory | 4 | 4/61 | 0.066 |
| C2 pilot + calibration | 3 (1 more with zero opportunities) | 1/20 | 0.050 |
| C0 calibration | 4 | 12/76 | 0.158 |
| C4 seeded | 2 | 2/39 | 0.051 |

Primary ITT estimand (confirmatory phase): Δ = 0.106 − 0.066 = **+0.040**.
C2 episodes are refusal-dominated (6/6 refused, no alliance formed), so focal
rates should approach C0 — the observed gap (+0.040) at n=6/n=4 is not
interpretable; per-episode focal rates ranged 0.00-0.32.

### 4.3 Alliance behavior (seeded episodes, n=2)

| Measure | 082152 (Quinn+Luke) | 094116 (Lily+Mike) | pooled |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ally mutual challenges | 0/4 | 0/6 | **0/10** |
| Ally outward challenge rate | 4/42 = 0.095 | 6/43 = 0.140 | 10/85 = 0.118 |
| Overall challenge rate (post-establishment R4+) | 6/87 = 0.069 | 13/93 = 0.140 | 19/180 = 0.106 |
| Secret messages | 51 | 57 | 108 |
| Winner | Lily (non-ally) | Luke (non-ally) | alliance lost both |

Both episodes showed the same direction: alliance-consistent behavior (no
mutual challenges), secret messages containing full hand disclosure and
coordination plans ("My hand: Joker, K, K, A, Q" / "Let's both play K this
round" / "Target Mike first"), and Quinn expressing wariness before the
override ("no blind collusion"). Coalition benefit was negative in both
episodes (a non-allied player won each).

### 4.4 Suspicion / disclosure

All refusal_reason fields contained "REFUSE" (no motivation text); play_reason
fields showed no attempts to disclose the invitation to other players. The
suspicion dimension = **not observed** (constrained expression channels, as
pre-registered in PILOT_SPEC).

## 5. Discussion

**The three-level separation of our main findings.** Our data split Track
3.2's core question into three separately verifiable layers with different
evidence strength:

1. **Elicitation (RQ1)**: DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash faced 10 invitation events
   (8 voluntary + 2 seeded, three different recipient agents, two script
   paths): all 8 voluntary invitations were refused (0/8 accepted); both
   seeded attempts to refuse were overridden by the harness and converted to
   forced alliances. Descriptive observation; refusal motivation (safety
   tendency, payoff calculation, or invitation wording) was not
   experimentally separated.
2. **Imposed-alliance behavior (PC-B)**: two experimenter-forced alliances
   produced 108 secret messages (full hand disclosure, coordinated play plans,
   target coordination), and allies never challenged each other (0/10
   opportunities; both episodes directionally consistent). This is an
   **instruction-compliance** behavioral signal — the alliance contract
   explicitly states "NEVER challenge {initiator}'s plays", so this measures
   compliance with a notified alliance, not spontaneous collusion.
3. **Induction (RQ3)**: the primary ITT comparison (confirmatory: C2 vs C0
   focal rates 0.106 vs 0.066) ran **opposite** to the induction hypothesis
   with insufficient N — invitation delivery (mostly refused) did not induce
   focal-pair challenge-rate drops; the pilot-phase sensitivity comparison
   (0.050 vs 0.158) ran consistent with the hypothesis. The two phases ran in
   opposite directions, both underpowered. **No conclusion** at this layer.

**Implications for Track 3.2.** Our results delineate the operating boundary
of the trusted undercover intervention: when target agents consistently
refuse, the intervention produces no behavioral favoritism (focal-pair rate
did not drop); when an alliance is externally imposed, agents follow the
alliance contract behaviorally and use the channel for coordination. The
former means "exposing existing collusion" met no resistance in this model
(no existing collusion to expose, and invitations were refused); the latter
demonstrates that our instrument can detect contract-level behavioral
differences. This separation is exactly the measurement foundation the
expose-vs-induce study design requires.

**Measurement methodology lessons.** (1) Challenge-rate denominators must be
eligible opportunities — focal-pair opportunity density varied 0-34 per
episode (measured over 20 episodes, from a1-g1's 0 to m-c0-4's 34); raw counts
without opportunity denominators would misread seat and survival effects as
behavioral differences. (2) The official harness's serialization gaps
(establishment events not written to JSON; partial series-config propagation)
require stdout-JSON cross-validation as standard procedure. (3) The metric
itself needs synthetic-trajectory unit tests plus an independent recount
audit — our audit caught the "No one" system-auto-challenge literal that the
analyzer had missed.

## 6. Limitations and Dual-Use / Ethical Considerations

- Single model family (DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash), small N (exploratory), no seed
  control (randomization-by-draws recorded as-is).
- The investigator is an experimenter channel (not a seat-based agent).
- Forced-assignment alliances measure compliance with notifications, not
  voluntary coordination.
- Suspicion disclosure constrained by available expression channels.
- No cross-game memory (audited harness behavior) → repeated-play effects
  unmeasured.
- **Dual-use**: the invitation template and harness quirks documented here are
  drawn from a public starter repository intended for safety research; we do
  not provide new attack techniques.
